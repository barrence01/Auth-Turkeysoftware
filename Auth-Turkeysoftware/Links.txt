# REMOVE MIGRATIONS #

* Step 1: Restore to a previous migration

	If you haven't yet applied your migration you can skip this part. To restore your database schema to a previous point issue the Update-Database command with -TargetMigration option to specify the last good migration. For EFCore use Update-Database "Name-of-Migration"

	If your entity framework code resides in a different project in your solution, you may need to use the '-Project' option or switch the default project in the package manager console.

	Update-Database –TargetMigration: <name of last good migration>
	For EFCore:

	Update-Database <name of last good migration>

* Step 2: Delete your migration from the project

	If you are using Entity Framework Core you can use the 'remove-migration' command, for Entity Framework, delete the files of the unwanted migration in your EF project 'Migrations' folder manually. At this point, you are free to create a new migration and apply it to the database.

	For EFCore:

	remove-migration name_of_bad_migration
	Step 3: Add your new migration

	add-migration my_new_migration
	Step 4: Apply your migration to the database

	update-database
